% RF Fundamentals

* Electromagnetic energy, electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular and propagate in free space.
* Rate of change of voltage, Rate of change of current
* RF waves have different speeds in different medium
* This should be taken in to account, when designing systems. As RF moves from antenna to PCB, it's characteristics changes.
* Important parameter in RF is Signal to Noise ratio. Nothing else matters
* Design of RF should consider maximize the power that can be achieved, high efficiency, less distortion and high output power level
* Transmit operates at very high power (Watts)
* Receive operates at very low power (Micro watts)
* Dynamic range of receiver is ratio of strongest signal that can be picked to the weakest signal that can be picked
* Non-linear characteristics is ugly in RF because it generates harmonics
* decibel was invented at Bell labs
* Log scale is better than linear scale, easy to understand and interpret (Only add and sub)
* dB = 20log(v2/v1) // Voltage
* dB = 10log(p2/p1) // Power
* dB indicates the ratio (gain/loss) and is unit-less entity
* dBm is absolute power, ratio of power with respect to 1mW
